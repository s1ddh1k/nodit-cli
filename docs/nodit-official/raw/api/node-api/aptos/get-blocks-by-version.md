# Get blocks by version

**`GET /blocks/by_version/{version}`**

This endpoint allows you to query transactions and block information for a specific block.

Transactions are limited by the default maximum transaction count. If not all transactions are returned, you must query the remaining transactions separately using the get transactions API. A 410 status code is returned if the block has been pruned.

## Parameters

| Name | In | Type | Required | Description |
|------|----|------|----------|-------------|
| version | path | integer | ✓ | The ledger version of the transaction to query for block information.  |
| with_transactions | query | boolean |  | If set to true, all transactions within the block are included. If not provided, transactions are not returned.  |

## Response

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| block_height | string | ✓ | Represents a 64-bit unsigned integer as a string. Expressed as a string for compatibility with languages such as JavaScript that do not natively support u64 values in JSON.  |
| block_hash | string | ✓ | A field representing the unique hash identifier of the block.  |
| block_timestamp | string | ✓ | A field representing when the block was created. Provided as a UNIX timestamp in microseconds, used to track block creation order and timing. The block timestamp is used to guarantee transaction ordering and measure block creation intervals.  |
| first_version | string | ✓ | A field representing the version number of the first processed transaction among those included in the block. In Aptos, each transaction has a unique version number indicating the overall execution order. first_version and last_version allow you to determine the version range of transactions within the block.  |
| last_version | string | ✓ | A field representing the version number of the last processed transaction among those included in the block. Together with first_version, defines the version range of transactions within the block, enabling sequential lookup of all transactions in the block.  |
| transactions | array |  | A list of all transactions included in the block.  |
| transactions[].type | string | ✓ | The type of the transaction |
| transactions[].hash | string | ✓ | A field representing the unique identifier of the transaction, provided as a 64-character hexadecimal string starting with 0x.  |
| transactions[].sender | string | ✓ | A field representing the address of the account that sent the transaction. When expressed as a string, it is displayed as a 64-character hexadecimal string, and may be abbreviated by omitting leading zeros and adding 0x.  |
| transactions[].sequence_number | string | ✓ | A field representing the transaction occurrence order. Represents a 64-bit unsigned integer as a string.  |
| transactions[].max_gas_amount | string | ✓ | A field representing the maximum amount of gas to use when the transaction occurs. Represents a 64-bit unsigned integer as a string.  |
| transactions[].gas_unit_price | string | ✓ | A field representing the gas price to use when the transaction occurs. Represents a 64-bit unsigned integer as a string.  |
| transactions[].expiration_timestamp_secs | string | ✓ | A field representing the transaction expiration time. Represents a 64-bit unsigned integer as a string.  |
| transactions[].payload | object | ✓ |  |
| transactions[].signature | object |  |  |
| transactions[].replay_protection_nonce | string |  | A field representing the nonce used to prevent transaction replay attacks. Represents a 64-bit unsigned integer as a string.  |
